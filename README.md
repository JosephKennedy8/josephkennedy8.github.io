## *Web Programming*

### Description:

Creates a simple web page. Made with a combination of *HTML*, *CSS* and *Jekyll Markdown*. The addition of *Jekyll* allowed me to make a default layout that can be used in multiple files within the repository without having to duplicate the *HTML*.

I also made a blog post that can be navigated to through the *Home* page of the website using markdown which made it easy to write text in a blog format and have it appear as a website in a browser.

### Repository Details:

_ _Layouts_ - Contains both the *default* layout for most sections of the web page and the *post* layout for blog posts.

_ _Posts_ - Contains the markdown for any blog posts that have been created.

_blog_ - Contains the _HTML_ page for each blog post

_css_ - Contains the CSS for any pages that use the _default_ layout

_.gitignore_ - Tells Git to ignore the _ _site_ directory as otherwise, it would be automaticallyt generated each time there was a commit.

_ _config.yml_ - Tells Jekyll the name of the project, the markdown language and configures a manually created URL for any blogs in the _blog_ directory.

_index.html_ - Contains the _HTML_ for the _Home_ page of the website and implements the _default_ layout.
