### Description:

Creates a simple web page. Made with a combination of *HTML*, *CSS* and *Jekyll Markdown*. The addition of *Jekyll* allowed me to make a default layout that can be used in multiple files within the repository without having to duplicate the *HTML*.

I also made a blog post that can be navigated to through the *Home* page of the website using markdown which made it easy to write text in a blog format and have it appear as a website in a browser.
